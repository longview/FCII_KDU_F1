# Firmware for replacement Falcon II KDU internals
See e.g. https://longview.be/devlog-2-the-falcon-ii-kdu.html and https://longview.be/harris-falcon-ii-kdu-kit.html â€” this code will not run a stock KDU!

Basically functional but early development.

# FCII_KDU.zip
This is the KiCAD project folder. Note: the schematic is updated vs. the devlog linked above but the PCB is not. As such you should refresh the PCB layout and make adjustments as needed.
